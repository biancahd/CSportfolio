 <p id=littlebio>Me! Hi, my name is Bianca H. D. and I'm a senior at Summit Preparatory High School in Redwood City California! I'm a new student, the class of 2016, derived from a foreign land where water is everywhere and <em> falls from the skies</em>. In otherwords, I'm from Seattle, Washington. I moved here in late August, just a few weeks ago to the sunny (dersert like) Bay Area, where I am currently. <br> <br> My name is Bianca - Bee for short. I'm still struggling to find myself. A quirky unicorn in this small place we call Earth and my goal is to help the those from less privileged countries. Work hard (first), play hard (after).</p>
    <p><strong>WHY BEE?</strong> My friends call me Bee for short - short for both Bianca (<em>"B"</em> would work, like in <em>Gossip Girl!!!</em>) but also short for Busy Bee. Calling me Bee got really popular at my old because I liked to do a log of activities, such as sports and music (see below). Feel free to do the same! I like it.</p>
    <p> I believe that life is what you make of it. I love to play cello, guitar, and piano; I run (cross country) and love to dance ... particularly in the rain.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Why these things?</h2>
    <p><strong>BOOKS   </strong> I love reading, and these books are classics that I've found to shape my life. <em>Jane Eyre</em> facinated me with it's amazing Victorian prose, <em>Harry Potter</em> got me to dream bigger (and wait for my Hogwarts letter that never came, sadly), and <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> inspired me to be the best and most quirky version of myself. </p>
    <p><strong>MUSIC   </strong>As a cellist, I love to listen to Dvorak; as an teenage girl, I love Mraz. It's a balance in my world - but I'd ultimately say that the theme song for my life is something completely different, by Pricilla Ahn <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQyCkwAGoVChMIne68osTqxwIVBy-ICh1ZQA-X&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3Ho8U2a3pMc&usg=AFQjCNH5UCKRiuTjJE9SgBiy5ffdI--ZFw&sig2=Kvo7gAhllSSPn6HmZD6EgQ">(here).</a> </p>
    <p><strong>SCHOOL    </strong>I'm in love with the programs, culutres, and communities at Stanford and UCLA. Shorecrest High School is my home - as much as I love Summit, Shorecrest has been the most amazing place in the world - I'm quite biased since I'm now a senior typing this. </p>
    <p><strong>SPORTS   </strong>pssst...<em> I'm a closet dancer. </em> I was Varsity tennis and cross country at my old school, and I love the mental focus and determination these two sports specifically demand on an individual, as well as team, aspect.</p>
    <p><strong>HOBBIES   </strong> Photography is something I love to do that picture to the right was taken on one of my sunrise adventures with one of my photography friends in Seattle this last summer. I love the art of photography - it's a matter of perspectives, and it's a way for me to show my view of the world, and its beauty, that we live in. I got into it when I got my hands on a camera in ...I'd say third grade? <em>note; thanks for assigning me to type this! I might write an essay for college on this topic now.</em> </p>
