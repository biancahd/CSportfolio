            <p><strong><em>How is HTML used?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>HTML is used to format text on a webpage, as well as format graphics on a webpage.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Where did HTML come from?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>HTML was born with the World Wide Web, created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN (European Laboratory for Particle Physics) in Geneva, Switzerland. The World Wide Web (WWW) was originally created so that the scientists in this huge hub of science could share their work with others in the work place. The WWW exploded with popularity throughout the 1900s.</p>
            <p>Hypertext, the basis of HTML, stemmed from the WWW. In the late 1980s, Bill Atkinson, a programmer for Apple Computer Inc. created the hypercard, based off of hypertext. By using this, applications and softwares were able to take form on screen, controlled and dictated through scripts.</p>
            <p>Later on in the 1990s, the internet, formally called the WWW, gained popularity, and many types of browsers, including Montulli's <em>Lynx</em> browser, as well as Sun Microsystem Inc.'s <em>The Mosaic</em> browser were released.</p>
            <p><strong><em>How is HTML written?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>Through HTML code! Strings of commands in arrow brackets:

            <p><strong><em>How is CSS used?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>CSS is used in partnership with HTML to format and add aesthetic qualities to a webpage. From coloring, format, shape, and design, the possibilities of what you can create with CSS are endless.</p>
