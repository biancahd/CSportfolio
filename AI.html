  <h4>Artificial Intelligence </h4>
  <h3>What is AI?</h3>

  <p>
    <em>Artificial intelligence (AI)</em> is the intelligence used by machines or software, as programmed by humans, but can learn to (almost) intuitively learn how to act on their own accordance within a parameter of functions that humans program it.
  </p>
  <br>


  <h3>Vindinium</h3></h3>
  <p><em><strong>Class Application: Vindinium</strong></em>
    <br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Vindinium is a simple game where the player can code their own AI bot and 
    place them in an arena server to battle against other bots. In this game, 
    bots can reboot health via going to taverns, gain riches via getting gold 
    by claiming mines, and attack others to take mines and gold from other bots 
    in the arena with them. Once killed, other bots take the other's belongings 
    - in this game, its mines and and gold. To reclaim health, players are 
    required to go to a tavern each turn to maintain their
    health levels, which are capped at 100 points of health. Attacking a mine 
    or other bots to get gold costs 20 health points. Each turn, you lose one 
    health point, so it's imperative to refuel at taverns, which cost 2 gold 
    units to heal 50 health points. Vindinium, in essence, is aimed at teaching 
    beginners how to program simple AI features in a fun and applicable way.

  <br>
  <p>
    <strong>Let's call my bot Dave.</strong>
    <br>
    So ... <em> what does Dave do?</em>
    <br>
    Dave uses the first 200 turns to collect gold from mines, and recoup his 
    energy at taverns. After 200 turns, he goes on to attack others with more 
    gold than him, and continues to collect gold and go to taverns, if others 
    around Dave can’t be attacked because they don’t have as much gold. 
    <br> <br> The three actions I’ve programmed Dave to do are: <br>
    1) go to taverns to recoup health, <br> 
    2) attack others with more gold than him, and <br>
    3) collecting gold from mines. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My bot first checks its own life to see whether or not it needs to go to a tavern to heal up – Dave will check to see if his health is above 60 health points or not – if not, he’l go to the tavern. This is done by having a for loop that takes an array of all the taverns, and uses an if statement to change the value of the variable <em> nearTav</em> to whatever the coordinates of the closest tavern is. Then, my AI goes through an <em>if/else statement</em> which first checks for a condition where bot.yourBot.life is less than or equal to 52, and if that is true then it takes the coordinates from the for loop and goes there using bot.findPath. 
<br>
  If Dave’s life isn’t in danger, and it’s been 200 turns, Dave begins his 
  quest! He goes to the nearest free mines and claims its gold, and continues 
  to do so as the turns go on. This is done a lot like how I programmed Dave 
  to do in my tavern function, except in the for loop it takes in an array of 
  all the free mines rather than the taverns. 
  <br> <br>
  Then in the same <em>if/else 
  statement</em>, an <em>else if</em>is added where the condition is that 
  <em>bot.yourBot.life</em> is more than 60 and <em>bot.freeMines.length</em> 
  more than 0, and if that is true then the bot will go towards the nearest 
  free mine. With <em>bot.freeMines.length</em>, if more than 0 does in the 
  conditions is that if there are no more free mines, the bot won't look for 
  free mines. 
  <br><br> 
  After this, Dave will look to pillage and steal...so Dave’s
  programmed to  look for others in the game to attack and steal their mines. 
  In this case, Dave is looking for the richest bot to attack. <br>
  </p>
<p>
    <strong>Code</strong>
    <br> I programmed my bot with simple code to establish a decent AI foundation to play the games in class and do tournaments against other bots. The maps varied each turn, but the above diagram is an example of what it looked like. The graphics look a
    lot like Minecraft, in my opinion. Here it is.

<p> In the end, Dave was semi-successful. He didn’t place first very often, 
but he did get the job done, usually placing in second in the Vindinium games. 
The process in general was pretty simple, but it was the act of putting it all 
ogether that was pretty complicated, most specifically with syntax. My 
understanding and opinion of AI in general has changed from mild interest to
avid appreciation – there’s a ton of work that goes in AI programming, and it’s 
crazy to think that we’ve been able to, as a society, produce such amazing
pieces of work such as Siri. I definitely overlooked this and took it 
for granted.
