    <h3>Why does this page exist?</h3>
            <p>This is my Computer Sciences class portfolio page. I'm coding and illustrating coding competency through this project, while also embracing the creativity aspects of it as well! <p> 
            <br>
            <h3>Why CS?(...and what does CS stand for?)</h3>

            <p> This class, <em>Introduction to Computer Sciences</em>, is a class that teaches the basic principals and fundamentals regarding computers, ranging from coding to physical computer parts and so much more!
                <br> <br>I personally chose this class because I believe that it's just as important to know what drives and controls our daily technologies, just as is it's important to know how to use them. </p>
 <h3>What's on here?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who</strong>: Bianca's webpage</li>
        <li><strong>What</strong>: Computer Sciences class portfolio</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong>: now!</li>
        <li><strong>...why?</strong>: To explain the purpose of this class, tell you a little about myself, and explain what I've learned.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML and CSS: tags and usage</li>
        <li>Bianca 101</li>
        <li>Physical CS: Taking Apart a Computer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Miscellaneous Things I've Learned:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>coding is like a language</li>
        <li>the phrase, "If you don't know it, search it up" doesn't disappear with age, and it's common in this class (for the better)</li>
        <li>coding is a larger part of our lives than you'd think</li>
    </ul>
    
<h3><strong>Why CS?</strong><br></h3>
<p>
    It’s as easy as a click of a <-button.> 
    <br> <br>
    At least, that’s what I had heard...until I sat down in my first Computer 
    Science class this last September.
    <br><br>
    But...what shape is that button? Color? Will it glow when you press it? Or 
    hover over it? Where is it placed? What is its <id> tag (and does it match 
    case by case, letter by letter, with any other duplicate buttons)? And the 
    all important question:  What does the button exactly...do?
    <br> <br>
    	Not so easy after all. 
    <br> <br>
    The questions are endless, the processes seemingly convoluted and 
    intertwined. This is computer science, or at least, some of the beginnings 
    I worked with this past year.  The mesh of theories and lines, the
    pairing of scientific procedure and real-life usage. It’s what truly is
    behind the “like” on that post you just laughed at, the robotic arm that’s
    manufacturing the newest Tesla, the document you type that dreaded English
    paper on. Computer science is apart of our daily lives, helping us become 
    more efficiently, bringing us together as a society on the internet. 
    <br> <br>
    I mean...there’s an app for that, isn’t there?
    <br> <br>
    
    Learning what computer science is, and how directly applicable it is in 
    the world has truly opened up my perspective of the world we live in. 
    Coding is complex, it’s a foreign language that mercilessly collapses 
    (or halts altogether) if there’s a single mistake – and for that reason, 
    I have a greater appreciation for all of those who so ardently write the 
    programs, applications, and technologies that we harness today in our daily 
    lives. 
    <br> <br>
    My first button I ever coded added up 2+2. Simple, just like a line of code. 
    However, it’s the addition of many, many other lines of code: 2+2+7+3+9, 
    etc. etc. these  random addition of lines upon lines of code snippets, they 
    add up – literally in this example, and figuratively when alluding to code 
    – to something so much greater. 
    <br> <br>
    Coding is a huge <function> in our lives. The prevalence and possibilities 
    that coding and computer science offer are what inspire me to learn more, 
    and since it’s apart of nearly all aspects of our lives, I hope to harness 
    the power of code to make my work more effective and efficient, whichever 
    field I may end up in, whether it be social media programming, dancing, 
    travelling, or even doing medical research. The opportunities are endless, 
    and coding is extremely prevalent in all that happen in our world, and I 
    can’t wait to learn more and use it more effectively in my own life. <br> <br>
