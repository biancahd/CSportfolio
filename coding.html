            <p><strong><em>How is HTML used?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>HTML is used to format text on a webpage, as well as format graphics on a webpage.</p>

            <p>HTML was born with the World Wide Web, created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN (European Laboratory for Particle Physics) in Geneva, Switzerland. The World Wide Web (WWW) was originally created so that the scientists in this huge hub of science could share their work with others in the work place. The WWW exploded with popularity throughout the 1900s.</p>
            <p>Hypertext, the basis of HTML, stemmed from the WWW. In the late 1980s, Bill Atkinson, a programmer for Apple Computer Inc. created the hypercard, based off of hypertext. By using this, applications and softwares were able to take form on screen, controlled and dictated through scripts.</p>
            <p>Later on in the 1990s, the internet, formally called the WWW, gained popularity, and many types of browsers, including Montulli's <em>Lynx</em> browser, as well as Sun Microsystem Inc.'s <em>The Mosaic</em> browser were released.</p>
            <p><strong><em>How is HTML written?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>Through HTML code! Strings of commands in arrow brackets:
                 from the syntax for HTML. By using simple tags, one can code a page of content, like this webpage I have here.</p>

            <p><strong><em>How is CSS used?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>CSS is used in partnership with HTML to format and add aesthetic qualities to a webpage. From coloring, format, shape, and design, the possibilities of what you can create with CSS are endless.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Where does CSS come from?</em></strong></p>
            <p>In short, CSS was derived from programers and creators who were apart of the initial browser/coding movement in the 1990s, including people like Tim Burners-Lee.</p>

            <p>Tags are hidden HTML commands that help code and shape a page. They're hidden <em>keywords</em> that prompt browsers to format to these attributes. 
                <br> <br>Examples of HTML tag attribute functions include bolding, coloring, and inserting pictures and text for a web page...but here's a better example: </p>
